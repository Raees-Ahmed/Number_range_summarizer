# Number_range_summarizer

Test code for software developer job at Impact

The code for the Number Range Summarizer classes was written using Eclipse IDE

The NumberRange Summarizer class is the class that was given to me in the email from impact. The Implementation class is the class written to implement the two functions given in the NumberRangeSummarizer class. The ImplementationTest class is a series of unit tests to test the function of the implemntation class.

From what i can see, the program works exactly as expected.
